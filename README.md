## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **HTML**: Semantic structure with ARIA labels for accessibility
- **CSS**: Modern CSS with 3D transforms and smooth transitions
- **JavaScript**: Modular class-based architecture with error handling

The JavaScript architecture includes three main classes:

- `ImageStackRotator`: Core functionality for image rotation and navigation
- `ImageStackApp`: Application initialization and coordination
- `PreloaderManager`: Loading state management and smooth transitions

### Key Technologies

- CSS 3D Transforms for stack effect
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layout
- CSS Custom Properties for theming
- CSS Keyframe Animations for enhanced UX
- ARIA Live regions for screen reader support
- Intersection Observer API for performance optimization
- Modular JavaScript Classes for maintainability

### Browser Support

- Modern browsers with CSS 3D transform support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Mobile-first responsive design

- **Images**: Optimized gradients instead of heavy image files
- **Loading**: Minimal DOM manipulation and efficient event delegation
- **Preloader**: Optimized loading experience with fade-out transition
- **Animation Performance**: Hardware-accelerated transforms and cubic-bezier easing
- **Memory Management**: Proper event cleanup and efficient DOM queries

## Customization

### Visual Enhancements

The application includes several premium visual effects:

- **Gradient Text Effect**: Main heading uses gradient background-clip for premium look
